Now that members of Generation Z are graduating college this spring. the most commonly-accepted definition says this generation was born after 1995, give or take a year-the attention has been rising steadily in recent weeks. GenZs are about to hit the streets looking for work in a labor market that's tighter than it's been in decades. And employers are planning on hiring about 17 percent more new graduates for jobs in the U.S. this year than last, according to a survey conducted by the National Association of Colleges and Employers. Everybody wants to know how the people who will soon inhabit those empty office cubicles will differ from those who came before them.

> give or take a year 短语，意为“上下浮动一年”。

现在 Z 世代的成员即将在这个春季大学毕业。普遍接受的定义认为，这一代人出生于 1995 年之后（上下浮动一年）。最近几周，关于 Z 世代的关注持续升温。他们即将进入劳动力市场，而当前的就业市场比过去几十年都更加紧张。根据全国高校与雇主协会（NACE）进行的一项调查，今年美国雇主计划招聘的新毕业生人数比去年多出约 17%。每个人都想知道，这些即将填补空缺办公隔间的人群与之前的几代人有何不同。

If"entitled"is the most common adjective, fairly or not, applied to millennials (those bom between 1981 and 1995), the catchwords for Generation Z are practical and cautious. According to the career counselors and expert who study them, Generation Zs are clear-eyed, economic pragmatists. Despite graduating into the best economy in the past 50 years, Gen Zs know what an economic train wreck looks like. They were impressionable kids during the crash of 2008, when many of their parents lost their jobs or their life savings or both. They aren,'t interested in taking any chances. The booming economy seems to have done little to assuage this underlying generational sense of anxious urgency, especially for those who have college debt. College loan balances in the U.S. now stand at a record $1.5 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve.

> entitled: 意思是“自以为应得的”，在此形容千禧一代有种被给予的态度。
> fairly or not: 插入语，用于强调后续观点可能带有争议。

如果说“自视过高”是无论是否公平都被最常用来形容千禧一代（1981年到1995年出生的人）的形容词，那么形容Z世代的流行词就是务实和谨慎。根据职业顾问和研究他们的专家的说法，Z世代是目光清晰、经济务实主义者。尽管Z世代在过去50年来最好的经济环境中毕业，他们深知经济崩溃的景象。他们在2008年的金融危机期间还是容易受影响的孩子，那时许多父母失去了工作、毕生积蓄，甚至两者都失去。他们不愿冒任何风险。蓬勃发展的经济似乎并未缓解这种潜在的世代性焦虑感和紧迫感，尤其是对于那些背负大学债务的人。据美国联邦储备统计，目前美国的大学贷款余额已创纪录地达到1.5万亿美元。

One survey from Accenture found that 88 percent of graduating seniors this year chose their major with a job in mind. In a 2019 survey of University of Georgia students, meanwhile, the career office found the most desirable trait in a future employer was the ability to offer secure employment (followed by professional development and training, and then inspiring purpose). Job security or stability was the second most important career goal (work-life balance was number one), followed by a sense of being dedicated to a cause or to feel good about serving the great good

埃森哲公司的一项调查发现，今年88%的毕业生在选择专业时考虑到了未来就业。同样，根据2019年对乔治亚大学学生的调查，职业服务办公室发现，未来雇主最令人向往的特质是能够提供稳定的就业（其次是职业发展和培训，以及激励性的目标）。工作稳定性或职业稳定性是第二重要的职业目标（工作与生活平衡是第一），紧随其后的是对事业的奉献感或为社会公益服务的满足感。
