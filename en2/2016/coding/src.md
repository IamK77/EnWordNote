It's true that high-school coding classes aren't essential for learning computer science in college. Students without experience can catch up after a few introductory courses, said Tom Cortina, the assistant dean at Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science.

　　However, Cortina said, early exposure is beneficial. When younger kids learn computer science, they learn that it's not just a confusing, endless string of letters and numbers - but a tool to build apps, or create artwork, or test hypotheses. It's not as hard for them to transform their thought processes as it is for older students. Breaking down problems into bite-sized chunks and using code to solve them becomes normal. Giving more children this training could increase the number of people interested in the field and help fill the jobs gap, Cortina said.

　　Students also benefit from learning something about coding before they get to college, where introductory computer-science classes are packed to the brim, which can drive the less-experienced or-determined students away.

　　The Flatiron School, where people pay to learn programming, started as one of the many coding bootcamps that's become popular for adults looking for a career change. The high-schoolers get the same curriculum, but "we try to gear lessons toward things they're interested in," said Victoria Friedman, an instructor. For instance, one of the apps the students are developing suggests movies based on your mood.

　　The students in the Flatiron class probably won't drop out of high school and build the next Facebook. Programming languages have a quick turnover, so the "Ruby on Rails" language they learned may not even be relevant by the time they enter the job market. But the skills they learn - how to think logically through a problem and organize the results - apply to any coding language, said Deborah Seehorn, an education consultant for the state of North Carolina.

　　Indeed, the Flatiron students might not go into IT at all. But creating a future army of coders is not the sole purpose of the classes. These kids are going to be surrounded by computers-in their pockets ,in their offices, in their homes -for the rest of their lives, The younger they learn how computers think, how to coax the machine into producing what they want -the earlier they learn that they have the power to do that -the better.

的确，高中编程课程对于在大学学习计算机科学来说并非必不可少。卡内基梅隆大学计算机科学学院助理院长汤姆·科尔蒂纳表示，没有经验的学生可以在修几门入门课程后赶上进度。

然而，科尔蒂纳指出，早期接触编程是有益的。当较小的孩子学习计算机科学时，他们会发现这不仅仅是一串让人困惑的字母和数字，而是一个用来构建应用程序、创作艺术作品或验证假设的工具。他们的思维方式不像年长学生那样难以转变。将问题分解成小块并用代码解决这些问题会变得很自然。科尔蒂纳说，让更多孩子接受这种训练，可以增加对该领域感兴趣的人数，并有助于填补就业缺口。

学生在上大学之前学一些编程也会受益，因为大学的计算机科学入门课程通常人满为患，这可能会让缺乏经验或不够坚定的学生望而却步。

Flatiron School 是一所教授编程技能的学校，学生需付费学习。它起初是为希望转行的成年人开设的众多编程训练营之一。Victoria Friedman，一名讲师表示，高中生学习的是相同的课程，但“我们试图让课程更贴近他们的兴趣”。例如，学生正在开发的一款应用可以根据你的心情推荐电影。

参加 Flatiron 班的学生可能不会辍学去建立下一个 Facebook。编程语言的更新换代很快，所以他们学习的“Ruby on Rails”语言到他们进入就业市场时可能已经不再流行了。但他们学到的技能，比如如何用逻辑思维解决问题并组织结果，可以适用于任何编程语言，北卡罗来纳州的一名教育顾问 Deborah Seehorn 表示。

事实上，Flatiron 的学生甚至可能不会从事 IT 行业。但开设这些课程的目的并不仅仅是为了培养未来的程序员。这些孩子将在未来的生活中被计算机所包围——在他们的口袋里、办公室里、家里。他们越早学会计算机的思维方式，越早掌握如何让机器按自己的意愿工作——越早意识到他们拥有这种能力——就越好。
