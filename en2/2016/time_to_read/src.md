That everyone's too busy these days is a cliché. But one specific complaint is made especially mournfully: There's never any time to read.

　　What makes the problem thornier is that the usual time-management techniques don't seem sufficient. The web's full of articles offering tips on making time to read: "Give up TV" or "Carry a book with you at all times." But in my experience, using such methods to free up the odd 30 minutes doesn't work. Sit down to read and the flywheel of work-related thoughts keeps spinning-or else you're so exhausted that a challenging book's the last thing you need. The modern mind, Tim Parks, a novelist and critic, writes, "is overwhelmingly inclined toward communication…It is not simply that one is interrupted; it is that one is actually inclined to interruption." Deep reading requires not just time, but a special kind of time which can't be obtained merely by becoming more efficient.

　　In fact, "becoming more efficient" is part of the problem. Thinking of time as a resource to be maximised means you approach it instrumentally, judging any given moment as well spent only in so far as it advances progress toward some goal. Immersive reading, by contrast, depends on being willing to risk inefficiency, goallessness, even time-wasting. Try to slot it as a to-do list item and you'll manage only goal-focused reading-useful, sometimes, but not the most fulfilling kind. "The future comes at us like empty bottles along an unstoppable and nearly infinite conveyor belt," writes Gary Eberle in his book Sacred Time, and "we feel a pressure to fill these different-sized bottles (days, hours, minutes) as they pass, for if they get by without being filled, we will have wasted them." No mind-set could be worse for losing yourself in a book.

　　So what does work? Perhaps surprisingly, scheduling regular times for reading. You'd think this might fuel the efficiency mind-set, but in fact, Eberle notes, such ritualistic behaviour helps us "step outside time's flow" into "soul time." You could limit distractions by reading only physical books, or on single-purpose e-readers. "Carry a book with you at all times" can actually work, too-providing you dip in often enough, so that reading becomes the default state from which you temporarily surface to take care of business, before dropping back down. On a really good day, it no longer feels as if you're "making time to read," but just reading, and making time for everything else.


如今大家都太忙，这已成了陈词滥调。但其中一个特别令人惋惜的抱怨是：总是没时间读书。

让问题更棘手的是，常规的时间管理技巧似乎不足以解决问题。网上充斥着各种文章，提供腾出阅读时间的小技巧，比如“放弃看电视”或“随身带一本书”。但根据我的经验，用这些方法勉强挤出30分钟并不起作用。你坐下来想读书，但脑海中工作的齿轮依然飞速运转，或者你累得要命，根本无心挑战一本艰深的书。小说家兼评论家蒂姆·帕克斯（Tim Parks）写道，现代人的大脑“非常倾向于交流……问题不仅在于我们被打断，而是我们本身就倾向于中断”。深度阅读不仅需要时间，还需要一种特殊的时间，这种时间不能仅靠提高效率来获得。

事实上，“提高效率”正是问题的一部分。将时间视为一种可以最大化利用的资源，会让你以功利的方式看待时间，认为只有在向某个目标推进时，这一刻才算被好好利用。而沉浸式阅读则需要愿意冒低效率、无目标、甚至浪费时间的风险。如果试图把它当作待办清单上的一项，你就只能做到目标导向的阅读——有用是有用，但却不是最令人满足的那种。加里·埃伯勒（Gary Eberle）在《神圣时间》（Sacred Time）一书中写道：“未来像一条源源不断、几乎无穷无尽的传送带上的空瓶子一样向我们涌来”，我们“感到必须在这些不同大小的瓶子（天、小时、分钟）经过时填满它们，因为如果它们被白白浪费，我们就错失了什么”。这种心态最不适合沉浸于一本书中。

那么，什么方法有效呢？也许令人惊讶的是，定期安排固定的阅读时间。你可能会认为这会加剧效率思维，但事实上，埃伯勒指出，这种仪式化的行为有助于我们“走出时间的流动”，进入“灵魂时间”。你可以通过只读纸质书或单功能电子阅读器来限制干扰。“随身带一本书”确实也能奏效——前提是你经常翻阅，让阅读成为你的默认状态，你偶尔浮出水面处理事务，然后再沉回阅读中。某个特别棒的日子里，阅读甚至不再像是“挤时间读书”，而仅仅是“阅读”，而其他一切都成了需要挤出时间来处理的事情。
