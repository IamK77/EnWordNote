Biologists estimate that as many as 2 million lesser prairie chickens---a kind of bird living on stretching grasslands-once lent red to the often grey landscape of the midwestern and southwestern United States. But just some 22,000 birds remain today, occupying about 16% of the species 'historic range.

　　The crash was a major reason the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)decided to formally list the bird as threatened ."The lesser prairie chicken is in a desperate situation ," said USFWS Director Daniel Ashe. Some environmentalists, however, were disappointed. They had pushed the agency to designate the bird as "endangered," a status that gives federal officials greater regulatory power to crack down on threats .But Ashe and others argued that the" threatened" tag gave the federal government flexibility to try out new, potentially less confrontational conservations approaches. In particular, they called for forging closer collaborations with western state governments, which are often uneasy with federal action. and with the private landowners who control an estimated 95% of the prairie chicken's habitat.

　　Under the plan, for example, the agency said it would not prosecute landowner or businesses that unintentionally kill, harm, or disturb the bird, as long as they had signed a range-wide management plan to restore prairie chicken habitat. Negotiated by USFWS and the states, the plan requires individuals and businesses that damage habitat as part of their operations to pay into a fund to replace every acre destroyed with 2 new acres of suitable habitat .The fund will also be used to compensate landowners who set aside habitat , USFWS also set an interim goal of restoring prairie chicken populations to an annual average of 67,000 birds over the next 10 years .And it gives the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA), a coalition of state agencies, the job of monitoring progress. Overall, the idea is to let "states" remain in the driver 's seat for managing the species," Ashe said.

　　Not everyone buys the win-win rhetoric. Some Congress members are trying to block the plan, and at least a dozen industry groups, four states, and three environmental groups are challenging it in federal court. Not surprisingly, doesn't go far enough. "The federal government is giving responsibility for managing the bird to the same industries that are pushing it to extinction, " says biologist Jay Lininger.



生物学家估计，曾经有多达200万只小草原榛鸡（生活在广袤草原上的一种鸟类）为灰色的美国中西部和西南部景观增添了一抹红色。然而，如今仅剩约22,000只鸟类，栖息范围仅占该物种历史分布范围的16%。

这种数量骤减是美国鱼类和野生动物管理局（USFWS）决定正式将该鸟列为“受威胁物种”的主要原因之一。USFWS局长丹尼尔·阿什表示：“小草原榛鸡处于极度危险的境地。” 然而，一些环保主义者对此感到失望。他们曾推动该机构将这种鸟类列为“濒危物种”，这一地位赋予联邦官员更大的监管权力来打击威胁。然而，阿什及其他人认为，“受威胁”标签赋予联邦政府更大的灵活性，可以尝试新的、可能不那么对立的保护方法。尤其是，他们呼吁与西部各州政府建立更紧密的合作关系，这些州通常对联邦行动感到不安，并与控制约95%小草原榛鸡栖息地的私人土地所有者合作。

根据计划，例如，只要土地所有者或企业签署了旨在恢复榛鸡栖息地的全范围管理计划，政府不会起诉那些无意间杀死、伤害或打扰这种鸟类的行为。该计划由USFWS和各州共同商定，要求在运营过程中破坏栖息地的个人和企业向一个基金缴费，用于将每破坏一英亩的土地替换为两英亩的新适宜栖息地。该基金还将用于补偿那些划拨土地作为栖息地的土地所有者。USFWS还设定了一个过渡目标：在未来10年内，将榛鸡种群恢复到年均67,000只。计划还将西部鱼类和野生动物管理机构协会（WAFWA，一些州机构组成的联盟）指定为监测进展的主体。总的来说，阿什表示，该想法是让“各州在管理该物种方面保持主导地位。”

然而，并非所有人都接受这种“双赢”的说辞。一些国会议员正试图阻止该计划，至少有12个行业组织、4个州和3个环保组织正在联邦法院挑战这一计划。毫不奇怪，批评者认为计划力度不足。“联邦政府正在将管理这种鸟类的责任交给推动其灭绝的同一产业，”生物学家杰伊·莱宁格表示。
