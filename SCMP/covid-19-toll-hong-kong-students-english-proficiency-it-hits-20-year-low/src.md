The English competency of Hong Kong’s Form Three students has dropped to its lowest level in nearly two decades. Education sector leaders are attributing the fall to learning challenges created by the Covid-19 pandemic.

香港中三学生的英语能力已降至近二十年来的最低水平。教育界领袖将这一下降归因于新冠疫情带来的学习挑战。

Proficiency in Chinese, English and maths among Primary Three pupils also fell to their worst levels in about 20 years.

小三学生的中文、英文和数学能力也下降到约二十年来的最低水平。

The results from the Territory-wide System Assessment, announced by the Education Bureau on Monday, also prompted an academic to call for urgent efforts to address the problem if the trend continued next year.

根据教育局周一公布的全港性系统评估结果，一位学者呼吁采取紧急措施来解决这一问题，以应对该趋势在明年持续下去的可能性。

The annual assessment was introduced in primary schools in 2004 before being extended to secondary schools. The data on competency levels is based on the percentage of students who pass its tests for the three subjects.

该年度评估于2004年在小学引入，之后推广到中学。能力水平的数据基于通过三门科目测试的学生百分比。

“Compared with last year, the performance of the Primary Three and Form Three students taking the assessment for Chinese, English and maths remains generally steady this year,” a bureau spokesman said.

“与去年相比，参加中文、英文和数学评估的小三和中三学生的表现今年总体保持稳定。”一位教育局发言人说道。

The latest figures were compiled from the scores of Primary Three and Form Three students who sat the assessment in the 2023-24 academic year.

According to the data, 67 per cent of Form Three pupils passed the English section, a drop of 0.8 percentage points from the previous year and representing a new low since the assessment was introduced in secondary schools.

The results also showed 78.7 per cent of Primary Three pupils had a basic level of English competency, the lowest since 2005 and a drop of 0.8 percentage points from the previous year.

According to the bureau, 80.9 per cent of Primary Three students passed the Chinese test. The figure was the lowest since the assessment was launched in primary schools.

Their performance in maths also suffered a decline, with 85.3 per cent of Primary Three pupils passing the test, the lowest level since 2005.

Form Three students fared better in Chinese and maths than their peers from past years.
